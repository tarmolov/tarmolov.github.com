**There is post of hate. Just emotions >:)**

Recently I've bought a laptop for my parents. I need a cheep one because this laptop will be used at dacha and actually there is a lot of ways to easily kill the laptop :) Finally I chose [ASUS F552CL model](http://market.yandex.com/model.xml?modelid=10565509). It's a pretty cool laptop (no for geeks, of course) but it has a big drawback â€” Windows 8.

Ta-dam! Actually it's not excited at all.

I used to be a user of previous products: Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me/2000, Windows XP (loved it!), and Windows Vista. Microsoft broke all my usual use cases in Windows 8. I were perplexed when Windows 8 started and didn't know what to do first. Where is My Computer? A! It's hidden from me starting with Windows 7. Good move! Thx!

I have one wish to the guy who decided to delete Start button: Burn in Hell! Many years Microsoft had been training users to use the Start button as a enter point and then... deleted it (**upd.** it was returned back in Windows 8.1 but it opens a "precious" Metro dashboard. Aggrrrhhh). This is a madness! You f*ked all your users.

Photo application doesn't work before update. I put some photos in the images folder and then want to see them. However, Windows insistently asks me to update photo applicaton before using it. What if I don't have the Internet right now? Why did you put the invalid application in the OS?

Music application has inaccurate icon. It seems that it's inaccurate because of many rough parts. It is an icon, no a picture. Use simple and smooth things. You've just killed a lot of perfectionists. The application itself sucks! The player controls will be hidden when I start playing music. What should I do to play a next one?

App store is half done. Sometimes it is reboting itself and continues do it until I kill it. Actually M$ was late with the App store. It seems that it already lost this game.

Windows 8 cannot be updated before all updates installed. Just say it! Insted of a clear message I got just a common message and felt perplexed again.

When Windows 8.1 is been installing, Windows showes a message that it can be updated. After a 5-6 reboots and 1.5 hours it installed anyway o_O

I hope Windows 9 will correct all this problems but it never restores my confidence in Microsofts products. Hasta la vista, Microsoft!

P.S. Windows 8 reminds me about an [epic Bill Gates's mail about downloading MovieMaker and the Digital Plus Package](http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/files/library/2003Jangatesmoviemaker.pdf).
