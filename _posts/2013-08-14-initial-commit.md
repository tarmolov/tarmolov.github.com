At long last I have started my blog. I am going to describe here my thoughts and ideas which relate with a web development. I will also plan to share my experience (successful and failed), my projects, and experiments.

I chose [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as my blog engine because:

* simple design;
* flexibility;
* local server for debugging and preview;
* markdown;
* gh-pages as free hosting;
* and, finally, I can write posts using my lovely vim ^^

Special thanks to [Roman Komarov](http://kizu.ru/en) who gave me permission to borrow his idea of a clean design. The idea is simple: [content is a king](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content#Content_is_king). No extra elements. No images. I love it.

Then I tested my blog using [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/). Actually it is a perfect tool for cross browser and cross platform testing ever. Why did I test my blog? I wanted to be sure that it works fine not only in desktop browsers but in mobile, too.

Anyway, things are moving...
