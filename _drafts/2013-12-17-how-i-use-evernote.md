![Evernote](/i/evernote.jpg)

When some of my friends saw that I use [Evernote](http://evernote.com/), they asked me how I use it. In this post I will cover this topic and I hope that described approaches and principals would be helpful for someone, too.

## Preface

This topic is about organizing information and issues. In my opinion, these activities are integral part of the programming.

Obviously developers have to plan their activity. It does not matter what kind of tools you use for the issue: special applications, stickers, todo-lists or keep all your plans in the head. To become more effective and professional developers we should study to plan and clear up what is important and what is not.

Developers resolve issues every day. As a result a huge amount of experience is collected and often shared in the Internet. When you find a piece of the useful experience, advice, or manual you will save it for future. So developers need a system for collecting and sorting information. Moreover, this system should be easy to access.

Today I use one system for planning my day and storing new information. This system is Evernote.

I can divide my planning and storing systems into two epoch:

  * before I met Evernote
  * and after :)

## Before Evernote

To be honest I did not care about planning before Yandex. I used to work in small companies and I did not have a lot of tasks. So my priotet goal was to collect and absorb knowledge from the great developers. I still do the same thing but some great developers have become closer. We work in the same company :)

As I remember I started saving useful and interesting resources in Favorites inside my browser. It is a simple and straightforward solution but it is not flexible enough. What if you need to save a picture or a part of the article? No way, you can save only link to the resource. So you send e-mail to yourself. Right? As a result you use two storage for the same issue and you should handle each of them separatelly.

Moreover, there was another shortcoming in Favorites. It contains only title and urls of the resources and you do not have a chance to do [full-text search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_text_search). What is a pitty when you cannot remember where you read something and remember only a couple of keywords... Also some sites were shut down from time to time and some of your links become unavailable and useless.

Third-part service for storing bookmarks like [Google bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/) have the same drawbacks.

Fortunatelly, I found Evernote with its amazing [Web Clipper](http://evernote.com/webclipper/). Since I had Evernote I have saved only articles, not links. Evernote has inbuilt full-text search which works pretty good in a majority of my cases.

So Evernote is good not only for storing information but for planning, too.

I used a lot of thing for planning. First thing which I tried was todo-lists in my paper notebook. I wrote my events, issues, goals, and ideas there. Then I realized that it is hard to find information which I needed. Of course I could reconsider structure of my notes and think up a new managment system. However, if I collect more than thousand notes I will face with the problem again.

So paper notes did not work for me. Just for the record, stickers did not, too.

I love simple tools and clear solutions. So next choice was Vim + grep. It provides text notes and a powerful native unix search. Dropbox helped me to get access to the notes from the Internet and my iPhone. However, it had a big drawback — no search in the iPhone. I often look through my notes and plans when I am in subway, for example, and I want to use search at times.

I do not like completed managment systems like. They set up their own rules and structures. But I want to build my own system which would be comfortable for me.

Fortunatelly, I have already had such system which I used for storing information. Thus I started to use Evernote as my time management system.

## With Evernote

As you read above I use Evernote as a storage and as a managment system.

Firstly, let us talk how I set up my Evernote storage.

### Evernote as a storage

I use only one notebook for storing information — reference. I tried to use several notebooks but then I realized that I had spent more time to sorting information than to using. So I decided to use single notebook and to mark my articles with tags.

Evernote allows you to create tags hierarchy. It is absolutelly up to you. For me a plain list of tags became more comfortable. In my opinion you should use search and your tags would be suggested to you. I barely expand my reference tags.

Also I have a special axuilary notebook — !inbox which I use for all new information. That is a rule: all new articles and notes should pass through inbox. !inbox is marked as a default notebook in my Evernote account.

I use a few ways to add new content to Evernote.

#### Manual
It is obvious that can manually add notes to Evernote. I use this method pretty often but I always add notes to the inbox notebook.

#### Web clipper
Evernote team created an amazing extension for all popular browsers which called Evernote Web clipper. It provides you an easy way to save web page or part of it to your Evernote account. It coul be done just in two clicks!

All clipped articles also are sent to inbox.

#### Forwarding e-mails
Evernote also gives a e-mail address which is connected with your account. So you can add notes by sending e-mails!

Usually given e-mail looks ugly and inmemmorabble. I suggest you create an extra e-mail account with memorable name and set up there e-mail forwarding to evernote e-mail. For example, your proxy e-mail can be evernote@example.com.

When somebody sends me an useful e-mail I always forward it to my evernote e-mail.

#### RSS
I read news and blogs as RSS feeds. Moreover, I use a special app for this issue — Reeder. It is available only for mac and ios devices. This application has a evernote button and you can send  a useful blog post by just one click.

#### Skitch
Skitch is a screenshot tool which was bought by Evernote. Since than Skitch has has Evernote suppirt and all your screenshots are uploading to Evernote account.

Usually I make a lot of screenshots at the work because it is a cool way to show my questions, bugs, or explain something.

However, I do not want to see all these screenshots in my inbox. Majority of them is temporal and useless but some of them can make a good service in the future. Thus I add an extra notebook called tmp especially for Skitch screenshots.

#### IFTTT

IFTT is a superb service to automate your social activity. I use it for saving some interesting tweets. Of course you can forward tweets to your evernote e-mail but I can show you better and easy way. You favorite a tweet and it will appear in your Evernote account. IFTT will do such magic if you use [this recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/108658). I strongly recommend you to automate all your possible activities.

### Evernote as a management system
Evernote is a cery flexible and customizeble system. You can adapt it to many various goals. I needed a managment system; so, Evernote made it possible, too.

First thing, which I tried, was TODO lists.

#### TODO lists
I created a notebook called todo and stored all my goals and tasks there. It is an easy and clean solutions and it works fine while number of tasks is not big.

When you are sinking in a sea of tasks GTD can save the day.

#### GTD
[GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)  was introduced by David Alan. This system helps you to organize all your everyday tasks. Initially it was developed for paper work but it can be used for digital life, too.

The idea is simple: just divide your big task into small ones and pick up the next step. It really helps you to complete even overwhelming tasks.

Another idea of GTD is about organizing information and new issues. You should create a special place for them called inbox. So you can store there all your new stuff without thoughts. However, each day you must empty your inbox, sort and organize all your incoming staff.

The golden rule is to write your thoughts and tasks. After that you can say to your brain, "It is ok, buddy. As you see I store your work in the good place. Stop thinking about it." And it works.

See a classic book [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/) for more information.

I borrowed wonderful [approach using Evernote as GTD system by Darren Crawford](http://darrencrawford.com/my-simple-gtd-evernote-combo/). It is clean and easy to use.

#### Agile results
GTD helped me to organize all my issues and plans but it did not help to get them done.
Agile results is not about doing more, it is about doing important things first.
